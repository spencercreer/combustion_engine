# Combustion Engine Plot
![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description
This MATLAB GUI plots the PV diagram for an internal combustion engine based on user inputs.

The user may model an engine design by changing the bore and stoke length of the cylinder. The user may also change the combustion values including fuel k, Cv, and R values and the engine surrounding values including intake pressure, exhaust pressures, and initial temperatures. The GUI plots the combustion processes of compression, combustion, expansion, exhaust, and intake and shows the influence of each parameter.
